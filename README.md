> Convert any async function to a cb-buffer handler.


At [**@jillix**](https://github.com/jillix) we created

[`cb-buffer`](https://github.com/jillix/node-cb-buffer)–a low-level

library for callback buffering.

`cb-bufferify` (this library) abstracts the things a little: it takes as input

the async function and it returns another function that is a `cb-buffer` handler

you can call as many times you want, the first async function being called just once.


## :cloud: Installation

```sh
$ npm i --save cb-bufferify
```


## :clipboard: Example



```js
// Dependencies
const bufferify = require("cb-bufferify");

// A function that returns a unique random number after one second
function getUniqueRand(prefix, callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        callback(prefix + Math.random());
    }, 1000);
}

// Bufferify the function, making it generate the number once, and
// call all the callback functions then
var fn = bufferify(getUniqueRand, ["Random number is: "]);

fn(console.log);
// => Random number is: 0.3325996194034815

fn(console.log);
// => Random number is: 0.3325996194034815

fn(console.log);
// => Random number is: 0.3325996194034815

fn(console.log);
// => Random number is: 0.3325996194034815
```

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`
